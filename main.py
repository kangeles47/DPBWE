# Initialization script for data-driven workflow:

# Asset Description
# Parcel Models

# Hazard Characterization
# Here is where we provide wind speed, location, etc. for data-driven roughness length
# Will also need to add WDR (rain rate) characterizations
# Will also need to add subroutine for WBD

# Asset Representation
# Populate component capacities:
if 'Parcel' in model:
    # Populate code-informed capacities (includes typical practice) for a given set of components:
    for assem in Parcel_assemblies:
        assem.capacity = function
else:
    pass

# Response Simulation

# Damage Estimation
