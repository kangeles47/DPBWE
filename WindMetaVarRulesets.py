    Parameters
    ----------
    stories: str
        Number of stories
    yearBuilt: str
        Year of construction.
    roofType: {'hip', 'hipped', 'gabled', 'gable', 'flat'}
        One of the listed roof shapes that best describes the building.
    occupancy: str
        Occupancy type.
    buildingDescription: str
        MODIV code that provides additional details about the building
    structType: {'Stucco', 'Frame', 'Stone', 'Brick'}
        One of the listed structure types that best describes the building.
    V_design: string
        Ultimate Design Wind Speed was introduced in the 2012 IBC. Officially
        called â€œUltimate Design Wind Speed (Vult); equivalent to the design
        wind speeds taken from hazard maps in ASCE 7 or ATC's API. Unit is
        assumed to be mph.
    area: float
        Plan area in ft2.
    z0: string
        Roughness length that characterizes the surroundings.
    Returns
