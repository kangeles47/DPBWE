        Ultimate Design Wind Speed was introduced in the 2012 IBC. Officially
        called â€œUltimate Design Wind Speed (Vult); equivalent to the design
        wind speeds taken from hazard maps in ASCE 7 or ATC's API. Unit is
        assumed to be mph.
    area: float
        Plan area in ft2.
    z0: string
        Roughness length that characterizes the surroundings.
